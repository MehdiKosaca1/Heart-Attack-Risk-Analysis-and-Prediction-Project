# Heart-Attack-Risk-Analysis-and-Prediction-Project-
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting heart attack risks using a dataset containing 303 observations and 14 variables. By leveraging logistic regression and statistical modeling techniques, we achieved a model accuracy of 90.81% (AUC). Key processes include data cleaning, correlation analysis, feature transformation, and model evaluation. 
## Dataset Features:
Age, Gender, Chest Pain Type, Resting Blood Pressure, Serum Cholesterol, Max Heart Rate, etc.
Target variable: Heart Attack Risk (High/Low)
## Highlights:
Comprehensive data exploration and visualization.
Transformation of key variables to enhance model performance.
Evaluation of multicollinearity and variable significance.
